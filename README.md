#### HI THERE!

This is the documentation for a my travel blog website: Whispers of Footprints! It has been built using the Django framework, Bootstrap version 4 for styling, as well as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Python. This project was built as an educational Project as part of Code Instituteâ€™s Diploma in Full Stack Software Development, but may be used in future as a genuine travel blog for real-world clients. Please use the table of contents below to navigate through all of the planning, features, deployment, testing and more!
