# A new view to update and delete comments
# Change model, create a view for update
# When the user clicks update, take the user to a new page which will have a form that is already filled in
# The get will get the comments form with the body prefilled, and once the user clicks on save, there would need a post function which posts the forms
# Only by registered and admin user, use login required mixin for classes, and decorator for functions
# If a user is editting the view, it should be the comment that the user comments
